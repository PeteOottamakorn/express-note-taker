Alternatively, use the link to the render page below.

## Usage

On the landing page, click on the button in the middle of the screen to be routed to the main pages with the notes. On this page, you can type in your note title and the text for your notes. Once there are inputs in both the title and text fields, a save button will appear in the upper right of the screen to save the note and it will display on the left. While in the process of typing in a note, a clear button will appear in the upper right corner of the screen to erase any input in the title and text fields. You can also click on any existing note on the left side of the screen to bring up the title and info on the main page. At this point, the upper right corner will populate with a new note button that will return you to the note input screen.
